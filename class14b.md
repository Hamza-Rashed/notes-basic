*We must be able to talk about what is messy or sad, to have hard conversations with colleagues who are driving us crazy. We can’t be focused just on efficiency. Rather, when we start the morning by collaborating with a team of engineers and then send emails to our marketing colleagues and then jump on a conference call, we want to know that those people really hear us. We want to know that work is more than just labor.*
*The company’s top executives long believed that building the best teams meant combining the best people. Rozovsky, now a lead researcher, needed to figure out which norms mattered most. Google’s research had identified dozens of behaviors that seemed important, except that sometimes the norms of one effective team contrasted sharply with those of another equally successful group.*
*The technology industry is not just one of the fastest growing parts of our economy; it is also increasingly the world’s dominant commercial culture.*
The Aristotle researchers decided to spread the results and create surveys to better understand how to accomplish this safe space within the teams, one team manager took an interest in the project and against his teams will, made them all take the survey. He was shocked by the results, as he thought he had a strong team, but had to come to terms with the fact that his team had many weaknesses. He took it upon himself as a team leader to solve this and decided to meet the team in a casual outing to discuss the survey results. He created a safe space by playing a game where they each said a fact about their personal life that the rest of the team wouldn’t know, this created empathy among the team and brought them closer as it built trust between the members. By doing so, he created a safe zone in and out of work and removed the idea of a “work", where you had to completely disconnect your work self from your social self. This led to a more comfortable environment and resulted in successfully implementing the psychological safety norm.
-	Some researchers found out that there is something called group norms that every group has and the success of this group depends on them following these rules.
-	Although these rules are not written and they are just assumed, they have an enormous effect on how groups work.
-	Some groups may have the norm of being inquisitive and they keep asking about everything including all of the details and they usually argue and have debates when they disagree with other members.
-	On the other hand, some groups might have the norms of being quiet and to do what they are asked for without discussing anything.
-	Some teams might have rules about the way you should speak. Some groups have rules about not interrupting the other speakers while others may welcome interrupting as a part that helps them to generate new ideas.
-	Some groups may stay formal with each other and keep distance while other teams may proceed to chat with each other.
-	That’s why the personality of the member does not always matter. If an introvert inters a team were debates are welcomed, he\she should try to get into these environments and the same applies to the extroverts.
-	The group norms are very important when it comes to the group’s productivity. Even when all of the group members are bright, when they do not work in a comfortable environment, the’ re unlikely to succeed.
To conclude, project Aristotle didn’t give the results we expected but they were definitely the results we needed to hear. There is no “right set of people” to create a good team, it didn’t depend on backgrounds or personalities or ethnicity or genders. A good team, depends on creating a safe space, where people felt comfortable and could speak up and take risks, while feeling heard and valued as group members. This, along with making the agenda and goal clear, having “equality in distribution of conversational turn-taking”, and “high average social sensitivity” resulted in identifying the norms for the perfect team.
