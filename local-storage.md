he read-only localStorage property allows you to access a Storage object for the Document's origin;
the stored data is saved across browser sessions. localStorage is similar to sessionStorage, except 
that while data stored in localStorage has no expiration time, data stored in sessionStorage gets 
cleared when the page session ends â€” that is, when the page is closed. (Data in a localStorage object
created in a "private browsing" or "incognito" session is cleared when the last "private" tab is closed.)

Data stored in either localStorage is specific to the protocol of the page. In particular, data stored 
by a script on a site accessed with HTTP (e.g., http://example.com) is put in a different localStorage
object from the same site accessed with HTTPS (e.g., https://example.com).

The keys and the values are always in the UTF-16 DOMString format, which uses two bytes per character.
As with objects, integer keys are automatically converted to strings.

## Example

The following snippet accesses the current domain's local Storage object and adds a data item to it using Storage.setItem().

```localStorage.setItem('myCat', 'Tom');```

The syntax for reading the localStorage item is as follows:

```const cat = localStorage.getItem('myCat');```

The syntax for removing the localStorage item is as follows:

```localStorage.removeItem('myCat');```

The syntax for removing all the localStorage items is as follows:

```localStorage.clear();```
