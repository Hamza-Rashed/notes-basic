# HTML img 
* Images can add a lot to your page. They can make it look more appealing but they can also convey
information much better than words in many circumstances. Including images is not too difficult 
but there are a few little tricks to doing it well. In this section we'll look at both.

* If you just want to learn about the img tag feel free to read just the first bit but if you want 
to discover more then I encourage you to keep on reading.

* an image is displayed using an img tag. It stands for image. Within the tag there are several attributes we may include but there are two which are fairly important.

``` HTML <img src="URL" alt="image description" > ```

* The src attribute stands for source. It is the location of the image which is to be included. It is a standard URL and similar to links may be absolute or relative. See the bit on Location Types in the previous section to find out more.

* The alt attribute stands for Alternate Text and is a simple description of what the image is. Normally you won't see the description but it has it's uses.

   * Screen readers (as used by people with vision impairment for example) will read the alt text as opposed to displaying the image.
    If there is an error loading the image for some reason then the alt text will be displayed instead.
    Search engines will use the alt text to help index images. Writing useful alt text can help give you a boost (if somewhat minor) in their rankings.

   ``` HTML <body>
    <p>Below is an image of a skateboard</p>
    <img src="./img/skateboard.png" alt="A green skateboard" >
    </body> ```
    
    
  # Color CSS

* Hexadecimal color notation is a way of declaring a color by indicating the amount of red, green and blue (RGB) it has.

This color notation is based on the hexadecimal numeral system (base 16).

Weâ€™re more accustomed to the decimal numeral system (base 10), so hex is a bit tricky to understand at first.

In the example above, black was declared as #000000, which means it has no red, green or blue. (Color theory tells us that the absence of any color is black.)

## In CSS hex color notation:

    * The amount of red is specified by the first two characters
    * The amount of green is specified by the second two characters
    * The amount of blue is specified by the last two characters

   #### A valid CSS hex color starts with a hash (#) followed by either six characters or three characters. Characters can be between 0-9 and A-F (or lowercase a-f).

 * The minimum value of each color channel is 00, which is equal to 0 in the decimal numeral system.

 * The maximum value of each color channel is FF, which is equal to 255 in the decimal numeral system.

# TEXT COLOR CSS

> Text Color

 * The color property is used to set the color of the text. The color is specified by:

    a color name - like "red"
    a HEX value - like "#ff0000"
    an RGB value - like "rgb(255,0,0)"

Look at CSS Color Values for a complete list of possible color values.

The default text color for a page is defined in the body selector.
 
    # Text Decoration

* The text-decoration property is used to set or remove decorations from text.

* The value text-decoration: none; is often used to remove underlines from links:
