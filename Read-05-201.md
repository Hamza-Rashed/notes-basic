# HTML img 
* Images can add a lot to your page. They can make it look more appealing but they can also convey
information much better than words in many circumstances. Including images is not too difficult 
but there are a few little tricks to doing it well. In this section we'll look at both.

* If you just want to learn about the img tag feel free to read just the first bit but if you want 
to discover more then I encourage you to keep on reading.

* an image is displayed using an img tag. It stands for image. Within the tag there are several attributes we may include but there are two which are fairly important.

``` HTML <img src="URL" alt="image description" > ```

* The src attribute stands for source. It is the location of the image which is to be included. It is a standard URL and similar to links may be absolute or relative. See the bit on Location Types in the previous section to find out more.

* The alt attribute stands for Alternate Text and is a simple description of what the image is. Normally you won't see the description but it has it's uses.

   * Screen readers (as used by people with vision impairment for example) will read the alt text as opposed to displaying the image.
    If there is an error loading the image for some reason then the alt text will be displayed instead.
    Search engines will use the alt text to help index images. Writing useful alt text can help give you a boost (if somewhat minor) in their rankings.
