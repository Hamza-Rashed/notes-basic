# Text Editor
### what is the Text Editor :
A text editor is a piece of software that you download and install on
your computer, or you access online through your web browser, that
allows you to write and manage text, especially the text that you write
to build a web site. The text editor has to be one of the most
important tools you can use as an aspiring web developer.

### Choosing A Text Editor
The most important features that should be in your text editor are :
1. code completion
2. syntax
highlighting
3. a nice variety of themes (to reduce eye strain and
fatigue)
4. the ability to choose from a healthy selection of
extensions available when you need them. You might find some other
features that are must-have’s, but I think these features are a good
start.

### The Difference Between Text Editors and IDEs
A text editor kind of gives away what it does in the title—it edits text.
It also manages text, and manages files. I love that name “text
wrangler” because in a way that’s what really a text editor does. It
wrangles your text together into something meaningful.
An IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is really a suite of
different software all coming together. An IDE is a text editor, a file
manager, a compiler, and a debugger all in one software package.
