## Lists 
1. ordered list :
show numbers beside the text 
2. unordered list :
show points beside the text and there's another style for unordered list 
and anything put in this lists you should put it between an opening ```<li>```
tag and a closing ```<li >``` tag
3. definition lists 
The definition list is created with
the ```<dl>``` element and usually
consists of a series of terms and
their definitions.
 - ```<dt>```
This is used to contain the term
being defined (the definition
term).
- ```<dd>```
This is used to contain the
definition.

and you can put a second list inside another list.

HTML allows the use of three types of lists:

* `<ol>`Ordered lists (where an order is indicated while listing the items, ex: 1,2,3 or a,b,c or i,ii,iii)
* `<ul>` Unordered lists (points that do not indicate any sort of order)
* `<dl>` Definition lists (lists compiled of terms and their definitions)

With ordered and ordered lists, each list item is defined using the `<li>` tag. However, with definition lists, the author must include within the `<dl>` tag a tag to c

# Boxes:

everything you see in the window browser it's inside boxes paragraph,title, lists, etc.
by default, a box is sized big enough to hold its counters of course you can change width and height with percentages or ems, pixels have been the most popular method to use  also you can give boxes
1. Border:
Every box has a border even if
it is not visible or is specified to
be 0 pixels wide

2. Margin:
Margins sit outside the edge
of the border. You can set the
width of a margin to create a
the gap between the borders of two
adjacent boxes.

3. Padding
Padding is the space between
the border of a box and any
content contained within it.
Adding padding can increase the
readability of its contents.

CSS treats HTML elements as though each one is in its own box. The properties of these boxes are what CSS manipulates to change their appearance. Such as:

* Box dimensions (width, height)
* Overflow (what happens to extra content)
* Boarders (separating the edge of one box from another)
* Margin (sits outside the border)
* Padding (the space between the border and the box contents)

# LOOPS ON JS:
if the condition returns true a code block will keep running until the condition returns false and there are 3 types of loops:
1. FOR to run code a specific number of times

2. while: to keep code run 

3. do while: very similar to the do-while loop but has one key difference, it will always run the statements inside the curly braces at least once. even if the condition evaluates to false
