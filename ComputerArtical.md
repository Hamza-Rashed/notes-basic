 > Hamza Rashed Syrian from Daraa . I studied civil engineering in Syria, but I could not continue because of the war in Syria .. Then I left Syria and came to Jordan ..
I am now working as a full stack developer

 ** In computer engineering **
> computer architecture is a set of rules and methods that describe the functionality,
> organization, and implementation of computer systems. Some definitions of architecture define it as describing
> the capabilities and programming model of a computer but not a particular implementation. In other definitions
> computer architecture involves instruction set architecture design, microarchitecture design, logic design, and implementation.

* The first documented computer architecture was in the correspondence between Charles Babbage and Ada Lovelace, 
describing the analytical engine. When building the computer Z1 in 1936, Konrad Zuse described in two patent 
applications for his future projects that machine instructions could be stored in the same storage used for data,
i.e., the stored-program concept.Two other early and important examples are:

   * John von Neumann's 1945 paper, First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC, which described an organization of logical elements;and
   * Alan Turing's more detailed Proposed Electronic Calculator for the Automatic Computing Engine, also 1945 and which cited John von Neumann's paper.
