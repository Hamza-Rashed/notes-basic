# Error Handling & Debugging

> In an ideal world everyone would write perfect code and there would never be any need to debug.
However in reality, virtually every project is going to require some degree of debugging. The 
more complex the project the more like this is to be true. Fortunately LiveCode includes a full
plethora of debugging tools and techniques that make it quick and easy to track down errors. The
live run-edit cycle allows you to see the effect of corrections as soon as you make them. And, 
unlike working in a lower-level language, when you make a mistake you will receive a human-friendly
error message pointing you to where the error occurred, instead of the application unexpectedly quitting.

> As well as the set of built-in error reporting and debugging tools, LiveCode also allows you 
complete flexibility over error handling, allowing you to provide a customized experience to 
the end user of your application
