# what is javascript ?

** JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web
pages — every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to 
look at — displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video 
jukeboxes, etc. — you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved. It is the third layer of the layer 
cake of standard web technologies, two of which (HTML and CSS) we have covered in much more detail in 
other parts of the Learning Area **

* It is best to keep JavaScript code in its own JavaScript file.JavaScript files 
are text files like HTML pages and CSS style sheets,but they have the .js extension
*  We have to know that Dynamic web pages with JavaScript HTML,CSS and JS can’t be separated 

** JavaScript is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content,
control multimedia, animate images, and pretty much everything else. (Okay, not everything, 
but it is amazing what you can achieve with a few lines of JavaScript code ) **

* we can add some JavaScript to implement dynamic behaviour:
>const para = document.querySelector('p');

>para.addEventListener('click', updateName);

>function updateName() {
 > let name = prompt('Enter a new name');
 > para.textContent = 'Player 1: ' + name;

# About the statement
**A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow one-by-one**

# About the variables
**It’s a space in memory that store data of any type (numerical,string or boolean). We can declared the varible by : Var any thing= ;**
